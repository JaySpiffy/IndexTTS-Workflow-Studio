Modifications and Additions in This Project (IndexTTS Workflow Studio):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project includes the core functionalities of IndexTTS and incorporates the following significant modifications and additions developed by James A Whittaker-Bent:

*   **Comprehensive Gradio User Interface:**
    *   Developed a multi-tab Gradio application (`webui.py`, `ui_layout.py`, `ui_logic.py`) for an extended workflow.
    *   Features include script-based multi-line input, generation of multiple audio versions per line, complex seed management strategies.
    *   Implemented an interactive review process allowing playback, comparison, and selection of the best audio version for each line.
    *   Integrated speaker similarity analysis (using SpeechBrain) to provide feedback during review and enable threshold-based regeneration.
    *   Added functionality to regenerate specific lines or versions below a similarity threshold.
    *   Implemented project save/load functionality (via JSON).

*   **Extensive Audio Post-Processing:**
    *   Integrated a concatenation pipeline for selected audio lines (`ui_logic.py`).
    *   Implemented various optional audio effects using libraries like Pydub, Librosa, SciPy, and NoiseReduce (`audio_utils.py`, `ui_logic.py`), including:
        *   Per-segment and final peak normalization.
        *   Silence trimming.
        *   Pitch shifting and speed adjustment.
        *   Noise reduction.
        *   3-band Parametric EQ and 10-band Graphical EQ.
        *   Dynamic range compression.
        *   Reverb, Chorus, and Flanger effects.

*   **FastAPI Wrapper (`tts_api.py`):**
    *   Developed a separate FastAPI server to provide a simple API endpoint (`/synthesize`) for basic text-to-speech generation using a reference voice, intended for integration with other applications like DialogueLab.

*   **Supporting Modules:**
    *   Created utility modules (`app_context.py`, `constants.py`, `general_utils.py`, `audio_utils.py`)
